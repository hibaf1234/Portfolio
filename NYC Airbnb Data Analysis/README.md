# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

In the Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market project, I will apply data importing and cleaning skills to analyze the Airbnb market in New York. I will ingest and combine the data from multiple file types, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.  

I accessed this Data Analytical project from Data Camp. The focus of this project is to import and clean data.
