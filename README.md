# Video Game Sales Analysis:

**Video Games Python Code**

This repository contains Python code for analyzing video game sales data. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes information about various video games, such as sales rank, name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, and sales data for different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and others).

**Data Import and Cleaning:**
- Utilizes Pandas to import and clean the video game sales dataset.
- Drops missing values and checks for duplicates.
  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Provides a summary of the data, including statistics and data types.
- Visualizes sales distribution using histograms, boxplots, and quantile plots.
- Examines the correlation matrix to identify relationships between sales in different regions.

**Top 5 Analysis:**
- Identifies the top 5 best-selling games, genres, platforms, and publishers based on global sales.

**Sales Distribution:**
- Presents a bar chart showing the distribution of sales across different regions.

**Yearly Trends:**
- Displays a line plot illustrating the global sales trend from 1997 to 2016.
          
**Genre-Platform Combinations:**
- Utilizes a heatmap to visualize the global sales of different genre-platform combinations.

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Conducts hypothesis testing for platform impact, genre impact, and publisher impact on global sales.
- Builds a linear regression model to predict global sales based on genre, publisher, and platform.
- Assesses multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, and robustness of coefficient estimates.
- Uses cross-validation to evaluate model performance

# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

In the Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market project, I will apply data importing and cleaning skills to analyze the Airbnb market in New York. I will ingest and combine the data from multiple file types, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.  

I accessed this Data Analytical project from Data Camp. The focus of this project is to import and clean data.

# Tableau: Car Crash Data

Overview: In pursuit of contributing to automotive safety, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of NHSTA data on car crashes, specifically focusing on substance involvement. The resulting project is a dynamic Tableau dashboard designed to provide valuable insights into the impact of substances on car safety.

**Key Features:**

  **1) Substance Metrics Comparison:**
       - Parameter-driven switch between alcohol and drug metrics, enabling a detailed comparative analysis.

  **2) Weekly Crash Frequency:**
       - Visual representation of crash frequency throughout the week, offering insights into substance-related patterns.

  **3) Injury Impact Visualization:**
       - Graphic display of the impact of substance-related crashes on the severity of injuries sustained.

  **3) Crash Characteristics Analysis:**
       - Examination of crash characteristics and their correlation with hospitalization or fatality, categorized by alcohol or drug involvement.

This project serves as a testament to my commitment to leveraging data for informed decision-making in the realm of automotive safety. It is not only a showcase of technical skills but a demonstration of strategic thinking and analytical prowess.
