**NYC Airbnb Data Analysis**

In the Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market project, I will apply data importing and cleaning skills to analyze the Airbnb market in New York. I will ingest and combine the data from multiple file types, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.  

I accessed this Data Analytical project from Data Camp. The focus of this project is to import and clean data.

  **3) Injury Impact Visualization:**
       - Graphic display of the impact of substance-related crashes on the severity of injuries sustained.

  **3) Crash Characteristics Analysis:**
       - Examination of crash characteristics and their correlation with hospitalization or fatality, categorized by alcohol or drug involvement.

This project serves as a testament to my commitment to leveraging data for informed decision-making in the realm of automotive safety. It is not only a showcase of technical skills but a demonstration of strategic thinking and analytical prowess.
