**NYC Airbnb Data Analysis**
In the Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market project, I will apply data importing and cleaning skills to analyze the Airbnb market in New York. I will ingest and combine the data from multiple file types, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.  

I accessed this Data Analytical project from Data Camp. The focus of this project is to import and clean data.

**Tableau: Car Crash Data**

Overview: In pursuit of contributing to automotive safety, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of NHSTA data on car crashes, specifically focusing on substance involvement. The resulting project is a dynamic Tableau dashboard designed to provide valuable insights into the impact of substances on car safety.

Key Features:

  1) Substance Metrics Comparison:
       - Parameter-driven switch between alcohol and drug metrics, enabling a detailed comparative analysis.

  3) Weekly Crash Frequency:
       - Visual representation of crash frequency throughout the week, offering insights into substance-related patterns.

  3) Injury Impact Visualization:
       - Graphic display of the impact of substance-related crashes on the severity of injuries sustained.

  5) Crash Characteristics Analysis:
       - Examination of crash characteristics and their correlation with hospitalization or fatality, categorized by alcohol or drug involvement.

This project serves as a testament to my commitment to leveraging data for informed decision-making in the realm of automotive safety. It is not only a showcase of technical skills but a demonstration of strategic thinking and analytical prowess.

(P.S. PowerPoint attached incase Tableau not accessible to get idea of what the dashboard might look like, but open Tableau to see interactive features)
